// Package monitor runs everything that has to keep working whether or not
// anybody is looking: the watchdog that restarts dropped tunnels, the Telegram
// bot, and the alerts.
//
// It is a separate process from the web panel on purpose. These jobs used to
// live inside the panel, which meant that stopping the panel also stopped the
// watchdog and every alert — without saying so. A monitor that fails silently
// is worse than no monitor, because it is trusted.

//
//   - Bind failures are logged. They used to be discarded, and since port 1080
//     is the well-known SOCKS port it is frequently already taken. The relay
//     then never started, and the only symptom was the Telegram bot failing
//     with a bare "EOF" that pointed at the wrong machine entirely.
//   - It listens on the legacy fixed port as well as the derived ones, so a
//     tunnel configured by an older version keeps working after an upgrade.
